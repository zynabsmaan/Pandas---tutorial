# Pandas-tutorial

This tutorial is for learning basic commands of Pandas library. If you are starting to learn Pandas, this tutorial will help you to get with the most common commands.

Pandas is a library for exploring data in the form of table (columns, rows). Manipulating data becomes very efficient and easily with it.   

The dataset I used here is Titanic from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>. I include it in the repo you just pull it. I renamed it to "pandas.csv" and worked only with 30 rows for simplicity. 

The original dataset here you can download it from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data">here</a>.
